# RiotJS Project Template
A project template for building a single page web application with [RiotJS].

**Features**
* Small footprint.
* "Framework" is organized and easy to extend.
* Pages are sent when accessed rather than bundled together.
* Code quality ensured with tests and code-formatting tools.

```

Format the source files.
```sh

```

### Production
